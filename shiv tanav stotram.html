<div id="about" style="display:none"><br>
<p style="font-size:20px"><b><i>Shiva Tandava Stotram</b></i> is a Sanskrit stotram that describes Shiva's power and beauty. It is traditionally attributed to Ravana, the King of Lanka, who is considered to be a great devotee of Shiva. It is believed that Ravana composed the hymn in praise for Shiva, and pleading for moksha.</p>

<p class="actual">Jatatavigalajjala pravahapavitasthale<br>
Galeavalambya lambitam bhujangatungamalikam<br>
Damad damad damaddama ninadavadamarvayam<br>
Chakara chandtandavam tanotu nah shivah shivam<br>

<p style="color:black;">With his neck consecrated by the flow of water that flows from his hair,
And on his neck a snake, which is hung like a garland,
And the Damaru drum that emits the sound “Damat Damat Damat Damat”,
Lord Shiva did the auspicious dance of Tandava. May he give prosperity to all of us.

<p class="actual">Jata kata hasambhrama bhramanilimpanirjhari<br>
Vilolavichivalarai virajamanamurdhani<br>
Dhagadhagadhagajjva lalalata pattapavake<br>
Kishora chandrashekhare ratih pratikshanam mama<br>

<p style="color:black;">I have a deep interest in Shiva
Whose head is glorified by the rows of moving waves of the celestial Ganga river,
Which stir in the deep well of his hair in tangled locks.
Who has the brilliant fire burning on the surface of his forehead,
And who has the crescent moon as a jewel on his head.

<p class="actual">Dharadharendrana ndinivilasabandhubandhura<br>
Sphuradigantasantati pramodamanamanase<br>
Krupakatakshadhorani nirudhadurdharapadi<br>
Kvachidigambare manovinodametuvastuni<br>

<p style="color:black;">May my mind seek happiness in Lord Shiva,
In whose mind all the living beings of the glorious universe exist,
Who is the companion of Parvati (daughter of the mountain king),
Who controls unsurpassed adversity with his compassionate gaze, Which is all-pervading
And who wears the Heavens as his raiment.

<p class="actual">Jata bhujan gapingala sphuratphanamaniprabha<br>
Kadambakunkuma dravapralipta digvadhumukhe<br>
Madandha sindhu rasphuratvagutariyamedure<br>
Mano vinodamadbhutam bibhartu bhutabhartari<br>

<p style="color:black;">May I find wonderful pleasure in Lord Shiva, who is the advocate of all life,
With his creeping snake with its blackdish brown hood and the shine of its gem on it
Spreading variegated colors on the beautiful faces of the Goddesses of the Directions,
Which is coveblack by a shimmering shawl made from the skin of a huge, inebriated elephant.

<p class="actual">Sahasra lochana prabhritya sheshalekhashekhara<br>
Prasuna dhulidhorani vidhusaranghripithabhuh<br>
Bhujangaraja malaya nibaddhajatajutaka<br>
Shriyai chiraya jayatam chakora bandhushekharah<br>

<p style="color:black;">May Lord Shiva give us prosperity,
Who has the Moon as a crown,
Whose hair is bound by the black snake-garland,
Whose footrest is darkened by the flow of dust from flowers
Which fall from the heads of all the gods – Indra, Vishnu and others.

<p class="actual">Lalata chatvarajvaladhanajnjayasphulingabha<br>

Sudha mayukha lekhaya virajamanashekharam<br>
Maha kapali sampade shirojatalamastunah<br>

<p style="color:black;">May we obtain the riches of the Siddhis from the tangled strands Shiva’s hair,
Who devoublack the God of Love with the sparks of the fire that burns on his forehead,
Which is reveblack by all the heavenly leaders,
Which is beautiful with a crescent moon.

<p class="actual">Karala bhala pattikadhagaddhagaddhagajjvala<br>
Ddhanajnjaya hutikruta prachandapajnchasayake<br>
Dharadharendra nandini kuchagrachitrapatraka<br>
Prakalpanaikashilpini trilochane ratirmama<br>

<p style="color:black;">My interest is in Lord Shiva, who has three eyes,
Who offeblack the powerful God of Love to fire.
The terrible surface of his forehead burns with the sound “Dhagad, Dhagad …”
He is the only artist expert in tracing decorative lines
on the tips of the breasts of Parvati, the daughter of the mountain king.

<p class="actual">navina megha mandali niruddhadurdharasphurat<br>

<p style="color:black;">May Lord Shiva give us prosperity,
The one who bears the weight of this universe,
Who is enchanting with the moon,
Who has the celestial river Ganga
Whose neck is dark as midnight on a new moon night, coveblack in layers of clouds.

<p class="actual">Praphulla nila pankaja prapajnchakalimchatha<br>

Smarachchidam purachchhidam bhavachchidam makhachchidam<br>
Gajachchidandhakachidam tamamtakachchidam bhaje<br>

<p style="color:black;">I pray to Lord Shiva, whose neck is bound with the brightness of the temples
hanging with the glory of fully bloomed black lotus flowers,
Which look like the blackness of the universe.
Who is the slayer of Manmatha, who destroyed the Tripura,
Who destroyed the bonds of worldly life, who destroyed the sacrifice,
Who destroyed the demon Andhaka, who is the destroyer of the elephants,
And who has overwhelmed the God of death, Yama.

<p class="actual">Akharvagarvasarvamangala kalakadambamajnjari<br>
Rasapravaha madhuri vijrumbhana madhuvratam<br>
Smarantakam purantakam bhavantakam makhantakam<br>
Gajantakandhakantakam tamantakantakam bhaje<br>

<p style="color:black;">I pray to Lord Siva, who has bees flying all around because of the sweet
Scent of honey coming from the beautiful bouquet of auspicious Kadamba flowers,
Who is the slayer of Manmatha, who destroyed the Tripura,
Who destroyed the bonds of worldly life, who destroyed the sacrifice,
Who destroyed the demon Andhaka, who is the destroyer of the elephants,
And who has overwhelmed the God of death, Yama.

<p class="actual">Jayatvadabhravibhrama bhramadbhujangamasafur<br>

Dhimiddhimiddhimidhva nanmrudangatungamangala<br>
Dhvanikramapravartita prachanda tandavah shivah<br>

<p style="color:black;">Shiva, whose dance of Tandava is in tune with the series of loud
sounds of drum making the sound “Dhimid Dhimid”,
Who has fire on his great forehead, the fire that is spreading out because of the
breath of the snake, wandering in whirling motions in the glorious sky.

<p class="actual">Drushadvichitratalpayor bhujanga mauktikasrajor<br>
Garishtharatnaloshthayoh suhrudvipakshapakshayoh<br>
Trushnaravindachakshushoh prajamahimahendrayoh<br>
Sama pravartayanmanah kada sadashivam bhaje<br>

<p style="color:black;">When will I be able to worship Lord Sadashiva, the eternally auspicious God,
With equanimous vision towards people or emperors,
Towards a blade of grass and a lotus, towards friends and enemies,
Towards the most precious gem and a lump of dirt,
Toward a snake or a garland and towards the varied forms of the world?

<p class="actual">Kada nilimpanirjhari nikujnjakotare vasanh<br>
Vimuktadurmatih sada shirah sthamajnjalim vahanh<br>
Vimuktalolalochano lalamabhalalagnakah<br>
Shiveti mantramuchcharan sada sukhi bhavamyaham<br>

<p style="color:black;">When I can be happy, living in a cave near the celestial river Ganga,
Bringing my hands clasped on my head all the time,
With my impure thoughts washed away, uttering the mantra of Shiva,
Devoted to the God with a glorious forehead and with vibrant eyes?

<p class="actual">Imam hi nityameva muktamuttamottamam stavam<br>
Pathansmaran bruvannaro vishuddhimeti santata<br>
Hare gurau subhaktimashu yati nanyatha gatim<br>
Vimohanam hi dehinam sushankarasya chintanam<br>

<p style="color:black;">Anyone who reads, remembers and recites this stotra as stated here
Is purified forever and obtains devotion in the great Guru Shiva.
For this devotion, there is no other way or refuge.
Just the mere thought of Shiva removes the delusion
